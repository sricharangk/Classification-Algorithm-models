# Classification-Algorithm-models
Comparing different Machine Learning models on a dataset
The strategy is to apply default model first with no tuning of the hyperparameter and then tuned them with different hyperparameter values and then I'll plot ROC curve to select the best machine learning model.The models used are as follows: 1) Principal Component Analysis2)Logistic Regression 3)Gaussian Naive Bayes 4)Support Vector Machine 5)Random Forest Classifier 6)Simple neural network

**Code goes as follows:
1.Importing necessary libraries and Data

2.Encoding the Data

3.Checking the encoded values

4.Seperating Features and Labels

5.Standardising the data

6.Principal Component Analysis

7.Splitting the data into training and testing data

8.Default Logistic Regression

9.Logistic regression tuned model

10.Gaussian Naive Bayes

11.Support Vector Machine

12.Support Vector Machine without polynomial kernel

13.Support Vector machine with polynomial Kernel

14.Trying default Model - RandomForestClassifier

15.Neural Network- MLP neuron**
