Comparing different Machine Learning models on a dataset
The strategy is to apply default model first with no tuning of the hyperparameter and then tuned them with different hyperparameter values and then I'll plot ROC curve to select the best machine learning model.The models used are as follows: 1) Principal Component Analysis2)Logistic Regression 3)Gaussian Naive Bayes 4)Support Vector Machine 5)Random Forest Classifier 6)Simple neural network
